* **different channels** for mentors, groups, attendees, general
* **record talks** of introduction or lightning talks
* **tech check** of your workshop setup the day before
* **room for question** via chat, email
* **motivate people** make an introduction round or warm-up games
* **check attendance** motivate people to let you know if they are attending
* **spread the word** and inspire others to do the same
* **video first** its good to see people while speaking so motivate them to use it
* **shared drive** for material, videos
* **grid mode** of your video conference that everybody see each other
* **installation party** before the event to make sure, everybody is ready to go
* **mentors preperation** what to take care (here [my list](https://github.com/ng-girls/organizers-guide/blob/master/2-before-the-workshop/mentors_preperation.md) from usual workshops)
* **older people** what is the best tech setup for them? bigger hardware, are they using apps?

* **track progress** do you need to slow down, does anyone need help? shy people will not always ask for help.

* **prepare your material** make sample, small snippets, and let people go further if they stuck at one chapter
* **check if people understand** what you were talking about. ask questions
